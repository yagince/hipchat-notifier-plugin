# HipChatNotifier Plugin

Uses HipChat API v2.

What makes it different from other HipChat Jenkins Plugins?

* it works because it uses latest HipChat APIv2 :)
* can specify token created by room owner (no more HipChat admin required!),
* can define token per job (no more global token for all jobs set by Jenkins Administrator!).

## Download plugin

If you don't want to compile plugin yourself, feel free to download [latest pre-compiled version](https://github.com/havramar/hipchat-notifier-plugin/releases/latest) (pick `hipchat-notifier.hpi`) and go to [uploading instructions](#upload-plugin).

## Compile plugin (Ubuntu)

If you want to compile plugin yourself, follow these steps:

```
sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk maven2
git clone git@github.com:havramar/hipchat-notifier-plugin.git
cd hipchat-notifier-plugin
mvn package
```

As a result `target/hipchat-notifier.hpi` should be created.
